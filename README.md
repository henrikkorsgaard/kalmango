# A poor man's Kalman filter in Golang

This is my attempt on translating [kalmanjs](https://github.com/wouterbulten/kalmanjs) to Golang.

All credit to @wouterbulten for the orignal library and thinking.

## Disclaimer
I have zero knowledge of or experience with Kalman filters. This seem to work the same way as Kalmanjs, but I have no clue. Yes, this is reality when UI and web developers get caught up in complex development.
